	  track "github.com/middleware-labs/golang-apm/tracker"
	  mwchi "github.com/middleware-labs/golang-apm-go-chi"
)
```

## Configure Middleware APM

The code snippet below initializes Middleware Go APM package and shows how to use it with go-chi/chi/v5.

```
config, _ := track.Track(
    track.WithConfigTag(track.Service, "your service name"),
    track.WithConfigTag(track.Project, "your project name"),
    track.WithConfigTag(track.Token, "your access token"),
)
r := chi.NewRouter()
r.Use(mwchi.Middleware("my-server", mwchi.WithChiRoutes(r)))
```
